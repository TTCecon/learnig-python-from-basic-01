Problem: Problem: The Atreides family, a powerful noble house from the planet Caladan, wants to analyze the daily stock price fluctuations of their holdings in The Spacing Guild over the past week. 
The daily stock prices are as follows: [120.5, 122.8, 119.9, 121.3, 123.7, 122.0, 121.5]. Using a for loop, calculate the average stock price for the week and determine which day had the highest stock price.

Hint: You will need to use a for loop to iterate through the stock prices and a conditional statement to compare the prices day by day.

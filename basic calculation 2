Problem: 
You are an exchange student at NHH and want to share "Bubble Milk Tea" from Taiwan with your friends, Professor and Teaching assistants.
To ensure everyone gets a fair share, you decide to write a simple bubble quantity calculator, a calculator to measure quantity of bubble. 

If you have 359.64 grams of bubble and 7 people, how much bubble should each person get? Write down the answer based on your code. The result must display with two decimal places.

Ans:
total_bubble = float(input("Please enter the total amount of bubble (in grams): "))
people = int(input("Please enter the number of people: "))

bubble_per_person = total_bubble / people

print(f"Each person should get {bubble_per_person:.2f} grams of sugar.")

bubble_per_person = total_bubble / people

print(f"With 300 grams of bubble and 7 people, each person should get {bubble_per_person:.2f} grams of bubble.")
